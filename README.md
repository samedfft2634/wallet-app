<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<img src="https://github.com/samedfft2634/wallet-app/assets/100915606/a1c21220-0bde-44f1-850b-25e814420fb2" >

<br>
This is the biggest project I have ever done. Why? It looks like basic Financial movements page but it is not. In the background the page has beautiful structure to store your expenditures. With this feature you can see and update your incomes and expenditures when you get back on website. Updating is just adding and removing , has not edit action yet. <br><br>

* If there is a long expense name don't worry!
* With the responsive design, you can easily navigate through the tables if the expense name is long or if you have a large amount of expenses

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
First, you have to enter your income. If at least one field empty, system will fire error. <br>
Once you have your income/ incomes you can start your expenses <br>
There are three buttons for actions. <br>
1. Add button using for adding your incomes on the table of the bottom <br>
2. Save button using for adding your specify expense names , spent amound and last payment date. <br>
3. Clear Information button using for reseting all tables and clear your informations from everywhere on page.

## Notes
> [!NOTE]
> Great practice to DOM manipulating. <br>
> Big business in a short time. 🕓⌛ <br>
> The code is complex and poorly readable because it was prepared with Turkish concepts and presented in English<br>



> [!IMPORTANT]
>  It contains localStorage, so do not worry to lose your datas.  <br>
> This means that when you leave the page and come back, you can see what you left as it was.😉  <br>

> [!WARNING]  
> Input fields can not be empty.<br>
> You have to enter an income to start operatings<br>
> After enter income, you have to fill at least one  of expense field or spent amount.<br>
> Be carefull to clicking on "Clear Information". This button clears all really 😮😨
